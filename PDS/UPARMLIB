Sam -

I have set up user parmlibs for years on my own. I start by
copying the LOADCS member of SYS1.IPLPARM to LOADVC (Cold start)
and LOADVW (Warm start). I place a line in each of them ahead of
the IBM parmlibs that point to my parmlib SYS1USER.PARMLIB.
LOADVC sets the IEASYSxx suffix to VC and LOADVW sets the
IEASYSxx suffix to VW.

The IEASYSVW and IEASYSVC members in my parmlib are identical
except for 2 lines. IEASYSVC contains a CLPA and CMD=VC. IEASYSVW
contains CMD=VW. I then copy COMMND00 to COMMNDVC to do a JES2
cold start and copy COMMND00 to COMMNDVW and modify it to do a
JES2 warm start.

I add MSTRJCL=VW so the system uses the master JCL in my parmlib
in which I have added SYS1USER.PROCLIB. I then place JES2 in
SYS1USER.PROCLIB that contains my SYS1USER.PARMLIB(JES2PARMS) and
the proclibs SYS1USER.PROCLIB (modified system procs),
SYS1USER.TSOPROC (modified TSO procs) and SYS1USER.USERPROC (My
user procedures).

I also modify a number of other settings in my IEASYSVC and
IEASYSVW as follows:

CLOCK=VW,                     SELECT CLOCKVW
CMD=VC,                       SELECT COMMNDVC
LPA=VW,                       SELECT LPALSTVW
MLPA=VW,                      SELECT IEALPAVW, MLPA PARAMETERS
MSTRJCL=VW,                   SELECT MSTJCLVW, MASTER JCL
PROG=VW,                      SELECT PROGVW, DYNAMIC APF LIST
SCH=VW,                       SELECT SCHEDVW
SMF=VW,                       SELECT SMFPRMVW, SMF PARAMETERS
PROD=VW,                      SELECT IFAPRDVW
SVC=VW,                       SELECT IEASVCVW, USER SVCS
VAL=VW,                       SELECT VATLSTVW

This process allows me to go from one operating system to another
fairly easily. There are changes that have to be made sometimes,
but they are usually small. The only system modification I need
to make is to add 2 LOADxx members to SYS1.IPLPARM.

Hi Dave,

   Thanks for writing back.  I'm glad to know that IBM has
implemented "user PARMLIBs".  How do you set them up?  That
solves all the trickery that I used to have to go through for the
XMIT limits--zapping core.....  What manual describes them?

    Anyhow, please stay in touch.  I guess I've been working too
much on back-leveled OS/390 systems.

    All the best.....

Sam

  Thank you very much, for your response.

  I have copied IKJTSO00 to my userparmlib (I don't like to
  update any IBM libraries) and it works just fine. I had a
  follow-up question asking if there was a way to change the 00
  suffix to something else. I like to my own suffixes VC (Cold
  start) and VW (Cold/Warm start). The response I got was that
  IKJTSO00 could not be changed until zOS 1.3 .

  Thanks
