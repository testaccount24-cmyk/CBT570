Subject: Re: Accept Job Number

    Is the following what you need?
 It was stripped from a program I have to restart JOBs
 which was copied from a program I have to requeue JOBs.
 I did some slight editting so Yahoo doesn't mess up
 the formatting too bad.  It will anyway.


*   The following code finds the JES2 JOB or STC number
         USING PSA,R0      Set addressibility to the PSA
         L     R1,PSATOLD  Load the address of the TCB
         USING TCB,R1      Set addressibility to the TCB
         L     R1,TCBJSCB  Load the address of the JOBstep CB
         USING IEZJSCB,R1  Set addressibility to the JSCB
         L     R1,JSCBSSIB Load the addr. of the Sub-Sys ID Blk
         USING SSIB,R1     Set addressibility to the SSIB
         MVC   CMD+06(8),SSIBJBID Put JOB with number in $T command
         MVC   CMD+21(8),SSIBJBID Put JOB with number in $E command
