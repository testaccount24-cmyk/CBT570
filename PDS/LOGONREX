This morning I received an Email from Ken Burrow at Computer
Sciences Corporation with a recommendation that would allow a
LOGON REXX exec to be used instead of a LOGON CLIST.  Due to the
attention processing problems documented by OY59638, I have
always recommended using a LOGON CLIST.  That changes today.  By
using the 'queue "ISPF NOLOGO"' command instead of 'address tso
"ISPF NOLOGO"' to invoke ISPF from the REXX exec, ISPF runs under
native TSO instead of REXX.  That fixes the problem in OY59638.
So I would urge you all to convert your LOGON CLISTs to LOGON
REXX execs, even if you're not running Dynamic ISPF.  Here is my
sample TSOLOGON exec:

/* rexx */
/* trace i */
/*********************************************************************/
/* This exec replaces CLIST TSOLOGON.  The "queue" command at the    */
/* end of this exec allows ISPF to run natively under TSO instead of */
/* under REXX, which corrects the problem documented in OY59638.     */
/* Thanks to Ken Burrow at Computer Sciences Corporation for this    */
/* "queue" command method.                                           */
/*********************************************************************/
msgsave = msg()
x = msg('OFF')
address tso "ALLOC FI(ISPPROF) DA('"userid()".ISPF.ISPPROF') OLD"
if rc <> 0 then
   do
      profdsn = userid().ISPF.ISPPROF
      x = msg('ON')
      address tso "ALLOC FI(ISPPROF) DA('"profdsn"') NEW CATALOG",
                  "CYLINDERS SPACE(1 1) DIR(45) DSORG(PO) RECFM(F B)",
                  "LRECL(80) BLKSIZE(0)"
      if rc = 0 then
         say "ISPF profile dataset'"profdsn"'created"
      else
         say "Unable to allocate ISPF profile dataset'"profdsn"'"
   end
x = msg(msgsave)
queue "ISPF NOLOGO"

I'm excited to finally dump my last reason for using CLISTs.
I'll be following this up with an update to DISS, but I wanted to
get this out ASAP.  Let me know if you have any questions or
concerns.
