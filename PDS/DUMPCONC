Hi Sam,

The following is a procedure that we set up when we were having
problems with GRS. I believe that we first set this up under
OS/390 2.8. If is an easy way to dump multiple ASIDs across
multiple images in a Sysplex with a single command.

DUMP COMM,TITLE=(GRS Failure),PARMLIB=GR

Parmlib member/IEADMCGR will be used for any associated
GRS/Catalog address space/XCF problems. The COMM DUMP command
should only be executed on one LPAR within the SYSPLEX:

create the following in 'SYS1.PARMLIB' member/IEADMCGR

JOBNAME=(GRS*,XCF*,CATALOG)
DSPNAME=('GRS'.*,'XCFAS'.*)
SDATA=(COUPLE,XESDATA,RGN,ALLNUC,CSA,PSA,SQA,SUM,TRT,LSQA,GRSQ)
REMOTE=(SYSLIST=*('GRS*','XCF*','CATALOG'),DSPNAME,SDATA)

To generate an SVC dump members for GRS, XCFAS and Catalog on all
members of the SYSPLEX insure the following from any LPAR.

DUMP COMM,TITLE=(GRS Failure),PARMLIB=GR
